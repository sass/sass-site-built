<div class="sl-l-container sl-l-container--small">
  <p>Many of the most frequently-requested features for Sass have to do with its
imports. The import system that we’ve had since the very early releases of Sass
is, to put it simply, not great. It does little more than textually include one
Sass file in another, which makes it hard to keep track of where mixins,
functions, and variables were defined and hard to be sure that any new additions
won’t happen to conflict with something elsewhere in the project. To make
matters worse, it overlaps with <span class="caps">CSS</span>’s built-in <code>@import</code> rule, which forces us
to have <a href="/documentation/at-rules/import/">a bunch of heuristics</a>
to decide which is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>which.</p>
<p>Because of these problems and others, we’ve wanted to do a full overhaul of the
way Sass files relate to one another for a long time. Over the last few years,
I’ve been working with the Sass core team and Sass framework maintainers to
create a proposal for a module system that’s fit to replace <code>@import</code>. That
proposal is now in a place that the core team is pretty happy with, at least as
a starting point, so we want to open it up for community<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>feedback.</p>
<p>If you want to read the full proposal, <a href="https://github.com/sass/language/blob/main/accepted/module-system.md">it’s available on
GitHub</a>.
Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/sass/language/issues/new">file issues</a> for any
feedback you have. The main body of the proposal is written as a spec, so it’s
very detailed, but the Goals, Summary, and <span class="caps">FAQ</span> sections (reproduced below)
should be accessible to anyone familiar with<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Sass.</p>
<h2 id="goals" tabindex="-1">Goals<a class="anchor" href="#goals"><span class="visuallyhidden">Goals permalink</span></a></h2>
<h3 id="high-level" tabindex="-1">High-Level<a class="anchor" href="#high-level"><span class="visuallyhidden">High-Level permalink</span></a></h3>
<p>These are the philosophical design goals for the module system as a whole. While
they don’t uniquely specify a system, they do represent the underlying
motivations behind many of the lower-level design<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Locality</strong>. The module system should make it possible to understand a Sass
file by looking only at that file. An important aspect of this is that names
in the file should be resolved based on the contents of the file rather than
the global state of the compilation. This also applies to authoring: an author
should be able to be confident that a name is safe to use as long as it
doesn’t conflict with any name visible in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encapsulation</strong>. The module system should allow authors, particularly
library authors, to choose what <span class="caps">API</span> they expose. They should be able to define
entities for internal use without making those entities available for external
users to access or modify. The organization of a library’s implementation into
files should be flexible enough to change without changing the user-visible<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration</strong>. Sass is unusual among languages in that its design leads to
the use of files whose entire purpose is to produce side effects—specifically,
to emit <span class="caps">CSS</span>. There’s also a broader class of libraries that may not emit <span class="caps">CSS</span>
directly, but do define configuration variables that are used in computations,
including computation of other top-level variables’ values. The module system
should allow the user to flexibly use and configure modules with<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>side-effects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="low-level" tabindex="-1">Low-Level<a class="anchor" href="#low-level"><span class="visuallyhidden">Low-Level permalink</span></a></h3>
<p>These are goals that are based less on philosophy than on practicality. For the
most part, they’re derived from user feedback that we’ve collected about
<code>@import</code> over the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>years.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Import once</strong>. Because <code>@import</code> is a literal textual inclusion, multiple
<code>@import</code>s of the same Sass file within the scope of a compilation will
compile and run that file multiple times. At best this hurts compilation time
for little benefit, and it can also contribute to bloated <span class="caps">CSS</span> output when the
styles themselves are duplicated. The new module system should only compile a
file<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backwards compatibility</strong>. We want to make it as easy as possible for people
to migrate to the new module system, and that means making it work in
conjunction with existing stylesheets that use <code>@import</code>. Existing stylesheets
that only use <code>@import</code> should have identical importing behavior to earlier
versions of Sass, and stylesheets should be able to change parts to <code>@use</code>
without changing the whole thing at<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>once.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-goals" tabindex="-1">Non-Goals<a class="anchor" href="#non-goals"><span class="visuallyhidden">Non-Goals permalink</span></a></h3>
<p>These are potential goals that we have explicitly decided to avoid pursuing as
part of this proposal for various reasons. Some of them may be on the table for
future work, but we don’t consider them to be blocking the module<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic imports</strong>. Allowing the path to a module to be defined dynamically,
whether by including variables or including it in a conditional block, moves
away from being declarative. In addition to making stylesheets harder to read,
this makes any sort of static analysis more difficult (and actually impossible
in the general case). It also limits the possibility of future implementation<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>optimizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Importing multiple files at once</strong>. In addition to the long-standing reason
that this hasn’t been supported—that it opens authors up to sneaky and
difficult-to-debug ordering bugs—this violates the principle of locality by
obfuscating which files are imported and thus where names come<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extend-only imports</strong>. The idea of importing a file so that the <span class="caps">CSS</span> it
generates isn’t emitted unless it’s <code>@extend</code>ed is cool, but it’s also a lot
of extra work. This is the most likely feature to end up in a future release,
but it’s not central enough to include in the initial module<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Context-independent modules</strong>. It’s tempting to try to make the loaded form
of a module, including the <span class="caps">CSS</span> it generates and the resolved values of all its
variables, totally independent of the entrypoint that cause it to be loaded.
This would make it possible to share loaded modules across multiple
compilations and potentially even serialize them to the filesystem for
incremental<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>compilation.</p>
<p>However, it’s not feasible in practice. Modules that generate <span class="caps">CSS</span> almost
always do so based on some configuration, which may be changed by different
entrypoints rendering caching useless. What’s more, multiple modules may
depend on the same shared module, and one may modify its configuration before
the other uses it. Forbidding this case in general would effectively amount to
forbidding modules from generating <span class="caps">CSS</span> based on<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>variables.</p>
<p>Fortunately, implementations have a lot of leeway to cache information that
the can statically determine to be context-independent, including source trees
and potentially even constant-folded variable values and <span class="caps">CSS</span> trees. Full
context independence isn’t likely to provide much value in addition to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased strictness</strong>. Large teams with many people often want stricter
rules around how Sass stylesheets are written, to enforce best practices and
quickly catch mistakes. It’s tempting to use a new module system as a lever to
push strictness further; for example, we could make it harder to have partials
directly generate <span class="caps">CSS</span>, or we could decline to move functions we’d prefer
people avoid to the new built-in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>modules.</p>
<p>As tempting as it is, though, we want to make all existing use-cases as easy
as possible in the new system, <em>even if we think they should be avoided</em>. This
module system is already a major departure from the existing behavior, and
will require a substantial amount of work from Sass users to support. We want
to make this transition as easy as possible, and part of that is avoiding
adding any unnecessary hoops users have to jump through to get their existing
stylesheets working in the new module<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>system.</p>
<p>Once <code>@use</code> is thoroughly adopted in the ecosystem, we can start thinking
about increased strictness in the form of lints or TypeScript-style
<code>--strict-*</code> flags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code splitting</strong>. The ability to split monolithic <span class="caps">CSS</span> into separate chunks
that can be served lazily is important for maintaining quick load times for
very large applications. However, it’s orthogonal to the problems that this
module system is trying to solve. This system is primarily concerned with
scoping Sass APIs (mixins, functions, and placeholders) rather than declaring
dependencies between chunks of generated<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">CSS</span>.</p>
<p>We believe that this module system can work in concert with external
code-splitting systems. For example, the module system can be used to load
libraries that are used to style individual components, each of which is
compiled to its own <span class="caps">CSS</span> file. These <span class="caps">CSS</span> files could then declare dependencies
on one another using special comments or custom at-rules and be stitched
together by a code-splitting<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>post-processor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary<a class="anchor" href="#summary"><span class="visuallyhidden">Summary permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>This proposal adds two at-rules, <code>@use</code> and <code>@forward</code>, which may only appear at
the top level of stylesheets before any rules (other than <code>@charset</code>). Together,
they’re intended to completely replace <code>@import</code>, which will eventually be
deprecated and even more eventually removed from the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>language.</p>
<h3 id="use" tabindex="-1"><code>@use</code><a class="anchor" href="#use"><span class="visuallyhidden">@use permalink</span></a></h3>
<p><code>@use</code> makes <span class="caps">CSS</span>, variables, mixins, and functions from another stylesheet
accessible in the current stylesheet. By default, variables, mixins, and
functions are available in a namespace based on the basename of the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">URL</span>.</p>
<pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss"><span class="token keyword">@use</span> <span class="token string">"bootstrap"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token selector">.element </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">@include</span> bootstrap.float-left<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>In addition to namespacing, there are a few important differences between <code>@use</code>
and <code>@import</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@use</code> only executes a stylesheet and includes its <span class="caps">CSS</span> once, no matter how
many times that stylesheet is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>used.</li>
<li><code>@use</code> only makes names available in the current stylesheet, as opposed to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>globally.</li>
<li>Members whose names begin with <code>-</code> or <code>_</code> are private to the current
stylesheet with <code>@use</code>.</li>
<li>If a stylesheet includes <code>@extend</code>, that extension is only applied to
stylesheets it imports, not stylesheets that import<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that placeholder selectors are <em>not</em> namespaced, but they <em>do</em> respect<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>privacy.</p>
<h4 id="controlling-namespaces" tabindex="-1">Controlling Namespaces<a class="anchor" href="#controlling-namespaces"><span class="visuallyhidden">Controlling Namespaces permalink</span></a></h4>
<p>Although a <code>@use</code> rule’s default namespace is determined by the basename of its
<span class="caps">URL</span>, it can also be set explicitly using <code>as</code>.</p>
<pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss"><span class="token keyword">@use</span> <span class="token string">"bootstrap"</span> <span class="token module-modifier keyword">as</span> b<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token selector">.element </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">@include</span> b.float-left<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The special construct <code>as *</code> can also be used to include everything in the
top-level namespace. Note that if multiple modules expose members with the same
name and are used with <code>as *</code>, Sass will produce an<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>error.</p>
<pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss"><span class="token keyword">@use</span> <span class="token string">"bootstrap"</span> <span class="token module-modifier keyword">as</span> *<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token selector">.element </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">@include</span> float-left<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="configuring-libraries" tabindex="-1">Configuring Libraries<a class="anchor" href="#configuring-libraries"><span class="visuallyhidden">Configuring Libraries permalink</span></a></h4>
<p>With <code>@import</code>, libraries are often configured by setting global variables that
override <code>!default</code> variables defined by those libraries. Because variables are
no longer global with <code>@use</code>, it supports a more explicit way of configuring
libraries: the <code>with</code> clause.</p>
<pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss"><span class="token comment">// bootstrap.scss</span>
<span class="token property"><span class="token variable">$paragraph-margin-bottom</span></span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1rem <span class="token statement keyword">!default</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token selector">p </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token property">margin-top</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 0<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token property">margin-bottom</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token variable">$paragraph-margin-bottom</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss"><span class="token keyword">@use</span> <span class="token string">"bootstrap"</span> <span class="token module-modifier keyword">with</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>
  <span class="token property"><span class="token variable">$paragraph-margin-bottom</span></span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1.2rem
<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>This sets bootstrap’s <code>$paragraph-margin-bottom</code> variable to <code>1.2rem</code> before
evaluating it. The <code>with</code> clause only allows variables defined in (or forwarded
by) the module being imported, and only if they’re defined with <code>!default</code>, so
users are protected against<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>typos.</p>
<h3 id="forward" tabindex="-1"><code>@forward</code><a class="anchor" href="#forward"><span class="visuallyhidden">@forward permalink</span></a></h3>
<p>The <code>@forward</code> rule includes another module’s variables, mixins, and functions
as part of the <span class="caps">API</span> exposed by the current module, without making them visible to
code within the current module. It allows library authors to be able to split up
their library among many different source files without sacrificing locality
within those files. Unlike <code>@use</code>, forward doesn’t add any namespaces to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>names.</p>
<pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss"><span class="token comment">// bootstrap.scss</span>
<span class="token keyword">@forward</span> <span class="token string">"functions"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">@forward</span> <span class="token string">"variables"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">@forward</span> <span class="token string">"mixins"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="visibility-controls" tabindex="-1">Visibility Controls<a class="anchor" href="#visibility-controls"><span class="visuallyhidden">Visibility Controls permalink</span></a></h4>
<p>A <code>@forward</code> rule can choose to show only specific<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>names:</p>
<pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss"><span class="token keyword">@forward</span> <span class="token string">"functions"</span> <span class="token module-modifier keyword">show</span> color-yiq<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>It can also hide names that are intended to be<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>library-private:</p>
<pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss"><span class="token keyword">@forward</span> <span class="token string">"functions"</span> <span class="token module-modifier keyword">hide</span> assert-ascending<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="extra-prefixing" tabindex="-1">Extra Prefixing<a class="anchor" href="#extra-prefixing"><span class="visuallyhidden">Extra Prefixing permalink</span></a></h4>
<p>If you forward a child module through an all-in-one module, you may want to add
some manual namespacing to that module. You can do what with the <code>as</code> clause,
which adds a prefix to every member name that’s<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>forwarded:</p>
<pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss"><span class="token comment">// material/_index.scss</span>
<span class="token keyword">@forward</span> <span class="token string">"theme"</span> <span class="token module-modifier keyword">as</span> theme-*<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>This way users can use the all-in-one module with well-scoped names for theme<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>variables:</p>
<pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss"><span class="token keyword">@use</span> <span class="token string">"material"</span> <span class="token module-modifier keyword">with</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token property"><span class="token variable">$theme-primary</span></span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> blue<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>or they can use the child module with simpler<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>names:</p>
<pre class="language-scss"><code class="language-scss"><span class="token keyword">@use</span> <span class="token string">"material/theme"</span> <span class="token module-modifier keyword">with</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token property"><span class="token variable">$primary</span></span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> blue<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="import-compatibility" tabindex="-1"><code>@import</code> Compatibility<a class="anchor" href="#import-compatibility"><span class="visuallyhidden">@import Compatibility permalink</span></a></h3>
<p>The Sass ecosystem won’t switch to <code>@use</code> overnight, so in the meantime it needs
to interoperate well with <code>@import</code>. This is supported in both<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a file that contains <code>@import</code>s is <code>@use</code>d, everything in its global
namespace is treated as a single module. This module’s members are then
referred to using its namespace as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a file that contains <code>@use</code>s is <code>@import</code>ed, everything in its public <span class="caps">API</span>
is added to the importing stylesheet’s global scope. This allows a library to
control what specific names it exports, even for users who <code>@import</code> it rather
than <code>@use</code> it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to allow libraries to maintain their existing <code>@import</code>-oriented <span class="caps">API</span>,
with explicit namespacing where necessary, this proposal also adds support for
files that are only visible to <code>@import</code>, not to <code>@use</code>. They’re written
<code>&quot;file.import.scss&quot;</code>, and imported when the user writes <code>@import &quot;file&quot;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="built-in-modules" tabindex="-1">Built-In Modules<a class="anchor" href="#built-in-modules"><span class="visuallyhidden">Built-In Modules permalink</span></a></h3>
<p>The new module system will also add seven built-in modules: <code>math</code>, <code>color</code>,
<code>string</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>selector</code>, and <code>meta</code>. These will hold all the
existing built-in Sass functions. Because these modules will (typically) be
imported with a namespace, it will be much easier to use Sass functions without
running into conflicts with plain <span class="caps">CSS</span><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>functions.</p>
<p>This in turn will make it much safer for Sass to add new functions. We expect to
add a number of convenience functions to these modules in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>future.</p>
<h4 id="meta-load-css" tabindex="-1"><code>meta.load-css()</code><a class="anchor" href="#meta-load-css"><span class="visuallyhidden">meta.load-css() permalink</span></a></h4>
<p>This proposal also adds a new built-in mixin, <code>meta.load-css($url, $with: ())</code>.
This mixin dynamically loads the module with the given <span class="caps">URL</span> and includes its <span class="caps">CSS</span>
(although its functions, variables, and mixins are not made available). This is
a replacement for nested imports, and it helps address some use-cases of dynamic
imports without many of the problems that would arise if new members could be
loaded<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>dynamically.</p>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions" tabindex="-1">Frequently Asked Questions<a class="anchor" href="#frequently-asked-questions"><span class="visuallyhidden">Frequently Asked Questions<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Why this privacy model?</strong> We considered a number of models for declaring
members to be private, including a <span class="caps">JS</span>-like model where only members that were
explicitly exported from a module were visible and a C#-like model with an
explicit <code>@private</code> keyword. These models involve a lot more boilerplate,
though, and they work particularly poorly for placeholder selectors where
privacy may be mixed within a single style rule. Name-based privacy also
provides a degree of compatibility with conventions libraries are already<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>using.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Can I make a member library-private?</strong> There’s no language-level notion of a
“library”, so library-privacy isn’t built in either. However, members used by
one module aren’t automatically visible to downstream modules. If a module
isn’t <a href="#forward"><code>@forward</code>ed</a> through a library’s main stylesheet, it won’t
be visible to downstream consumers and thus is effectively library-private.
<br><br> As a convention, we recommend that libraries write library-private
stylesheets that aren’t intended to be used directly by their users in a
directory named <code>src</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How do I make my library configurable?</strong> If you have a large library made up
of many source files that all share some core <code>!default</code>-based configuration,
we recommend that you define that configuration in a file that gets forwarded
from your library’s entrypoint and used by your library’s files. For<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>example:</p>

<p>This is still just a proposal. We’re pretty happy with the overall shape of the
module system, but it’s not at all set in stone, and anything can change with
enough feedback provided by users like you. If you have opinions, please <a href="https://github.com/sass/language/issues/new">file
an issue on GitHub</a> or just <a href="https://twitter.com/SassCSS">tweet
at @SassCSS</a>. We’ll take anything from “it looks
awesome” to “it looks awful”, although the more specific you can be the more
information we have to work<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>with!</p>
