      <p>You may not know <a href="https://github.com/mgreter">Marcel Greter</a>, but you almost
certainly know his work. For more than two years, he has been the #1 contributor
on LibSass and is the #2 contributor for the history of the project. His
monumental efforts, together with <a href="https://github.com/xzyfer">Michael Mifsud</a>,
are what has kept LibSass thriving recently and why it has reached feature
parity with Ruby Sass and is now used by more users than Ruby Sass every<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>day.</p>
<p>Presently, as we are pivoting to a new development model and release cadence,
Marcel has decided it is the best time for him to exit the LibSass core team. We
are truly sad to see him go, but we wish him well in all his new endeavors.
Please join us in thanking him for all his hard work. You can follow and tweet

      <p class="sl-c-attribution">Posted 29 February 2016 by Natalie<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Weizenbaum</p>

      <p>As of version 3.5, Ruby Sass will drop support for Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9.3. We
will continue to support Ruby 2.0.0 and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>higher.</p>
<p>Ruby 1.8.7 was retired by the Ruby maintainers in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/06/30/we-retire-1-8-7/">June
2013</a>, and Ruby
1.9.3 was retired in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/02/23/support-for-ruby-1-9-3-has-ended/">February
2015</a>.
Despite that, we continued to maintain support for older versions because Ruby
1.8.7 was installed by default on Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X through Mountain Lion (which was
released in July<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>2012).</p>
<p>There are many users of Sass who aren’t independently users of Ruby. We wanted
to minimize the amount of work these users need to do to use Sass, which means
letting it run on their machine without also requiring them to install a new<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>language.</p>
<p>That decision wasn’t without costs, though. Most seriously, recent versions of
the <a href="https://github.com/guard/listen">listen package</a> didn’t support older Ruby
versions, and older versions of RubyGems weren’t clever enough to avoid
downloading them on incompatible Ruby versions. To work around this, we bundled
an older version of <code>listen</code> with Sass and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>used&#8230;</p>

      </h2>
      <p class="sl-c-attribution">Posted 9 December 2015 by Natalie<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Weizenbaum</p>

      <p>Interpolation—the ability to add variables and other snippets using <code>#{...}</code>—is
one of the handiest all-purpose features of Sass. You can use it just about
everywhere you might need to inject a variable, a function call, or some other
expression. In most of those places it just plops the value into the surrounding
text. It’s straightforward, easy to understand, and useful, which is exactly
what we want from a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>feature.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s only true in <em>most places</em>. For complicated historical
reasons, there’s one place where interpolation goes a little bit bananas: inside
an expression but outside quotes. Most of the time, it makes sense; if you write
<code>display: -#{$prefix}-box</code>, you’ll get what you expect. But if any operators
like <code>+</code> are used next to the interpolation, you start to get weird output. For
example, <code>$name + #{$counter + 1}</code> might return an unquoted string containing
the text <code>name + 3</code>.</p>
<p>This is really weird behavior. Why does <code>+</code> behave differently here than it does
everywhere else?<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Why&#8230;</p>

      <p class="sl-c-attribution">Posted 19 August 2014 by Natalie<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Weizenbaum</p>

      <p>We’ve been trying to increase the pace of Sass releases, and it looks like we’ve
succeeded. A mere five months after the release of <a href="/blog/sass-33-is-released">Sass
3.3</a>, we’re announcing the release of Sass 3.4.0,
codename Selective Steve. Faster releases mean fewer major features per release,
so there are only two big new things to talk about (although there are plenty of
little improvements you can read about in <a href="https://github.com/sass/ruby-sass/blob/stable/doc-src/SASS_CHANGELOG.md">the
changelog</a>).
As the version name suggests, both of these features have to do with<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>selectors.</p>
<h2 id="using-and-in-sass-script" tabindex="-1">Using <code>&amp;</code> in SassScript<a class="anchor" href="/blog/sass-34-is-released/#using-and-in-sass-script"><span class="visuallyhidden">Using <span class="amp">&amp;</span> in SassScript<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>“SassScript” is what we call the mini-language Sass uses for variables, property
values, and so forth. It’s mostly just <span class="caps">CSS</span> values, but it also supports custom
functions, arithmetic, and so forth. In Sass 3.4, we added support for something
new: the parent selector, <code>&amp;</code>.</p>
<p>Most Sass users will probably recognize <code>&amp;</code> from its previous appearances in
selectors around the world, where it’s used to explicitly refer to the parent
selector. For example, in <code>.parent {...</code></p>

      <p class="sl-c-attribution">Posted 8 March 2014 by Natalie<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Weizenbaum</p>

      <p>After ironing out a bunch of bugs in numerous release candidates, we’re finally
ready to release Sass 3.3.0, codename Maptastic Maple, for public consumption.
This release has a lot of exciting new features that you can read about in full
in <a href="https://github.com/sass/ruby-sass/blob/stable/doc-src/SASS_CHANGELOG.md">the
changelog</a>,
but there are three that I want to draw your attention to in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>particular.</p>

<p>As language designers, most of our job is to listen to feedback from users and
act upon it. This is tricker than it sounds: users are very good at knowing the
precise thing that they want to accomplish, but they tend not to have a sense of
how that fits into the big picture. So we take a large volume of user requests,
try to distill the core needs that aren’t being met, and see if we can come up
with features that hit as many of those as possible as simply as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>possible.</p>
<p>SassScript maps are a great example of this. We had<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>a&#8230;</p>
