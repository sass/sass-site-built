<div class="sl-l-container sl-l-container--small">
  <p>After much discussion among the Sass core team, we’ve come to the conclusion
that it’s time to officially declare that LibSass and the packages built on top
of it, including Node Sass, are deprecated. For several years now, it’s been
clear that there’s simply not enough engineering bandwidth behind LibSass to
keep it up-to-date with the latest developments in the Sass language (for
example, the most recent new language feature was added in <a href="https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.5.5">November 2018</a>). As
much as we’ve hoped to see this pattern turn around, even the excellent work of
long-time LibSass contributors Michael Mifsud and Marcel Greter couldn’t keep up
with the fast pace of language development in both <span class="caps">CSS</span> and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Sass.</p>
<p>I’ll go into detail about what this means below, but here are the major<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We no longer recommend LibSass for new Sass projects. Use <a href="/dart-sass">Dart Sass</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We recommend all existing LibSass users make plans to eventually move onto
Dart Sass, and that all Sass libraries make plans to eventually drop support
for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>LibSass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’re no longer planning to add any new features to LibSass, including
compatibility with new <span class="caps">CSS</span><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LibSass and Node Sass will continue to be maintained indefinitely on a
best-effort basis, including fixing major bugs and security issues and
maintaining compatibility with the latest Node<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>versions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-deprecate" tabindex="-1">Why deprecate?<a class="anchor" href="#why-deprecate"><span class="visuallyhidden">Why deprecate? permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>For several years now, Sass has managed to exist in an ambiguous kind of state
where LibSass was an officially-supported implementation in theory, but its
feature surface was static in practice. As time has gone on, it’s becoming
increasingly clear that this state causes substantial concrete problems for Sass
users. For example, we regularly see users confused as to why <a href="https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/2849">plain-<span class="caps">CSS</span> <code>min()</code>
and <code>max()</code> don’t work</a> and assuming Sass as a whole is at fault, when in fact
it’s only LibSass that doesn’t support that<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>feature.</p>
<p>Official support for LibSass doesn’t just cause pain for individual users.
Because LibSass doesn’t support the <a href="/blog/the-module-system-is-launched">Sass module system</a> that launched last
year, major shared Sass libraries have been unable to use it for fear that their
downstream users would be incompatible. By clearly indicating that all Sass
users should eventually move off of LibSass, we hope to make it more feasible
for these library authors to use more modern<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>features.</p>
<p>LibSass has even inhibited the development of the Sass language itself. We’ve
been unable to move forward with the proposal for <a href="https://github.com/sass/sass/blob/main/accepted/slash-separator.md">treating <code>/</code> as a separator</a>
because any code they’d write would either produce deprecation warnings in Dart
Sass or fail to compile in LibSass. By marking LibSass as deprecated, this
becomes much more feasible, and Sass becomes much better at supporting the
latest versions of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">CSS</span>.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-deprecated-mean" tabindex="-1">What does “deprecated” mean?<a class="anchor" href="#what-does-deprecated-mean"><span class="visuallyhidden">What does “deprecated” mean?<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>We’re choosing to use the term “deprecated” because it carries a lot of weight
in the programming community, and provides a strong signal that users should
start planning to move away from LibSass. However, it doesn’t mean that the
project is entirely dead. Michael Mifsud, the lead maintainer of LibSass and
Node Sass, has affirmed that he plans to continue maintenance on the same level
as the past few years. This means that although there will be no more features
added (and as such LibSass will slowly drift further and further out of
compatibility with the latest <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Sass syntax), there will continue to be
maintenance releases<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>indefinitely.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-portability-and-performance" tabindex="-1">What about portability and performance?<a class="anchor" href="#what-about-portability-and-performance"><span class="visuallyhidden">What about portability and performance?<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>LibSass today has two major benefits over Dart<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Sass:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Portability</strong>: since it’s written in C++, it’s easy to embed LibSass within
other programming languages and provide a native-feeling<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: calling out to LibSass via the C++ <span class="caps">API</span> is very fast relative
to the speeds of code written directly in scripting languages. In particular,
this means LibSass is substantially faster in JavaScript than Dart
Sass-compiled-to-<span class="caps">JS</span> (although it’s comparable to Dart Sass’s command-line<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>executable).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re working on addressing both of those with the <a href="https://github.com/sass/embedded-protocol">Sass embedded protocol</a>,
which runs a Sass compiler as a subprocess that can communicate with any host
language via message-passing. The embedded protocol supports all the features of
a native Sass <span class="caps">API</span>, including the ability to define custom importers and Sass
functions, while also providing the high performance of the <span class="caps">CLI</span> app. Dart Sass
has already implemented the compiler side of the embedded protocol, and a
JavaScript host for it is in active<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>development.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-migrate" tabindex="-1">How do I migrate?<a class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-migrate"><span class="visuallyhidden">How do I migrate?<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>If you’re a user of Node Sass, migrating to Dart Sass is straightforward: just
replace <code>node-sass</code> in your <code>package.json</code> file with <code>sass</code>. Both packages
expose the same JavaScript<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<p>If you’re using the SassC command-line interface, you can switch to <a href="/documentation/cli/dart-sass">Dart Sass’s
<span class="caps">CLI</span></a>. Note that this doesn’t have exactly the same interface as SassC, so you
may need to change a few<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>flags.</p>
<p>If you’re using LibSass through a wrapper library in another language, you can
either switch to the Dart Sass <span class="caps">CLI</span> or ask the maintainer of the LibSass wrapper
to convert it to a host for the <a href="https://github.com/sass/embedded-protocol">Sass embedded protocol</a>. The embedded protocol
allows any language to provide a native <span class="caps">API</span> that calls out to Dart<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Sass.</p>
<p>Please note that because activity on LibSass has been low for several years, it
has a number of outstanding bugs and behavioral variations from the Sass spec.
You may need to make minor updates to stylesheets to make them compatible with
Dart Sass. See <a href="https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Compatibility+-+P1+%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F%22">this list of major compatibility issues</a> for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>reference.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you" tabindex="-1">Thank you<a class="anchor" href="#thank-you"><span class="visuallyhidden">Thank you permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>Finally, I want to thank everyone who’s put so much time and energy into LibSass
and Node Sass over the years. It will always be a towering achievement, and
Sass’s popularity outside of the Ruby community is undoubtedly due in large part
to its existence. Many people have tried to implement Sass only to find that the
language is much deeper and more complex than they expected, and LibSass alone
among all of those implementations managed to become fully-featured enough to
provide real value for thousands if not millions of users. These maintainers
deserve to be proud of that work, and I hope they’ll always consider themselves
part of the Sass community going<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>forward.</p>
